# claimR
ClaimR-package for simple representative claim identification in R. 

All files are in the master branch, you can install the package using: 

```r
devtools::install_github("DariusRibbe/claimR", ref = "master")
```

If you want to use the Python integration, you need a running python installation and make sure your system allows access. Make sure, you have numpy, torch, and transformers installed, as installing them via the package may cause some errors. 

A detailed description of functions is avaiable from "A needle from the Haystack". Message me and I will provide the paper for you.
